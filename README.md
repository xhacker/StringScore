# StringScore

This fork was created to support Unicode characters, based on the fork which was created to prove that StringScore provides reasonable performance. The question about it was raised on the Stackoverflow question [Objective-c: Fast Fuzzy Search Match](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15012673/objective-c-fast-fuzzy-search-match/15014414#15014414).

## Setup code extracted

Mainly, the setup code is pulled out of the `scoreAgainst:` method, thus 3 new methods are added to `NSString+StringScore`:

````

- (NSCharacterSet *)invalidCharacterSet;
- (NSString *)decomposedStringWithInvalidCharacterSet:(NSCharacterSet *)invalidCharacterSet;

- (CGFloat) scoreAgainst:(NSString *)anotherString fuzziness:(NSNumber *)fuzziness options:(NSStringScoreOption)options
     invalidCharacterSet:(NSCharacterSet *)invalidCharacterSet decomposedString:(NSString *)string;
````

The first two can be used to generate the data that is needed for the scoring algorithm. It will speed up the operation if `scoreAgainst:` is called repeatedly on the same string.

## Additional changes

The other changes focus on speeding up the algorithm itself by generating fewer NSString objects.
